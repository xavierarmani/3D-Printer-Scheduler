# SE Project

## Project Overview

The CaMS Maker Lab Scheduling System (CMLSS) enables Lewis University students to reserve time to use the Labâ€™s 3D printers. This can be done through a mobile-friendly website interface. The website will also display the full schedule for each printer, which will include open, reserved, and unavailable time slots.

Lewis University students must first register user accounts before reserving times in the CMLSS. The requirements for a user account will be a Lewis University email address, password, and verification of training in the use of a 3D printer. Because of this verification step, students will apply for an account via the CMLSS, and await acceptance.

The software will also generate weekly usage reports of the 3D printers and other equipment in the Maker Lab. The report will include the use time for each piece of equipment, materials used,  users that reserved time, which machine they used, and how long they used that machine. This scheduling information will be stored in a database and will be maintained through the website.

Administrators, or admins, have special privileges. These accounts can set the times that printers are available for reservation. This means that admins can set the hours that the lab is open, and they can set when certain printers are available. Admins also have the responsibility of accepting or rejecting applications for user accounts and time slot reservations. Only administrators can register users and confirm time-slot reservations. This will all be done by the same website interface.


## Grading

The final project is 20% of your final grade.  The total score for the project is 100 points and is broken down as follows.

Assignment | Group/Individual | Points
--------------|-------------- |------:
**Group Organization and Set up**: Signed up for Blackboard group and GitHub group | Individual| 5
**Attendance/Participation**: Attended team meetings during class time and pushed code to GitHub repository  | Individual          | 25        
**Teamwork assessment**: Completed survey assessing team members.  Rating by team members.   | Individual  | 10  
**Code produced**: Grading of the project itself.  This grade will be based on functionality, documentation and user friendliness, code readability, efficiency, security and delivery (on time and in specified format) | Group  | 40    
**Presentation**: Grading of the presentation on __*Tuesday, May 9th at 10:30*__.  You must attend and participate to receive a score. | Group              | 20
